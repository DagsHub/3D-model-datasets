## About

The ModelNet40 dataset contains synthetic object point clouds. As the most widely used benchmark for point cloud analysis, ModelNet40 is popular because of its various categories, clean shapes, well-constructed dataset, etc. The original ModelNet40 consists of 12,311 CAD-generated meshes in 40 categories (such as airplane, car, plant, lamp), of which 9,843 are used for training while the rest 2,468 are reserved for testing. The corresponding point cloud data points are uniformly sampled from the mesh surfaces, and then further preprocessed by moving to the origin and scaling into a unit sphere.

3D shape is a crucial but heavily underutilized cue in object recognition, mostly due to the lack of a good generic shape representation. With the recent boost of inexpensive 2.5D depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect), it is even more urgent to have a useful 3D shape model in an object recognition pipeline. Furthermore, when the recognition has low confidence, it is important to have a fail-safe mode for object recognition systems to intelligently choose the best view to obtain extra observation from another viewpoint, in order to reduce the uncertainty as much as possible. To this end, it is proposed to represent a geometric 3D shape as a probability distribution of binary variables on a 3D voxel grid, using a Convolutional Deep Belief Network. The model naturally supports object recognition from 2.5D depth map, and view planning for object recognition.
